\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
Python is a popular, general-purpose, multi-paradigm,
open-source, scripting language. It is designed to emphasize code
readability -- has a clean syntax with high level data types. It is
suited for interactive work and quick prototyping, while being powerful
enough to write large applications in.

Python has a large number of available and well-written modules for
everything from abstract syntax trees to ZIP file manipulation. Its
ecosystem features extensive set of tools from JIT compiler\footnote{
PyPy (\url{http://pypy.org})} to fancy IDE\footnote{IPython
(\url{http://ipython.org})}. In this half-day workshop, you will be
introduced to basic Python language syntax and to its ecosystem.

\section{Objectives}\label{sec:objectives }
After taking this course, you should be able to:
\begin{itemize} \itemsep1pt \parskip0pt \parsep0pt
  \item use Python interactively
  \item execute a Python script at the shell
  \item use Python types, expressions, and None
  \item use string literals and string type (raw and unicode strings as well?)
  \item use Python statements (if...elif..else, for, pass, return,
continue, and so on)
  \item understand the difference between expressions and statements
  \item understand assignment semantics
  \item write and call a simple function (lexical scoping rule?)
  \item utilize high-level data types such as lists and dictionaries
  \item understand the difference between mutable and immutable objects
  \item write a simple class and access methods and attributes
  \item import and utilize a module (Beautiful Soup?)
  \item read from and write to a text file
  \item understand interpreter and compilers: CPython, PyPy, Cython
  \item see demonstration of IDE's: IDLE, IPython, IPython Notebook, hosted
environments
  \item understand the role of package managers: easy\_install, pip
  \item understand what NumPy does and what SciPy is (are?) 
  \item learn about resources for learning Python\footnote{tutorials,
        books, MOOC's, videos, web sites, Python Koans, Python Challenge, and
        Project Euler}

\end{itemize}

\section{Intended Audience}\label{sec:intended_audience}
This workshop is for those who have some experience in using at least
one scripting language\footnote{Stata, R, MATLAB, Perl, Ruby, emacs
lisp, bash, or PowerShell, etc.} but who do not know Python. It is
assumed that you can edit a text file using your favorite editor, and be
able to execute your script file on the command line of a shell.

Python comes pre-installed in Mac OS X and Linux. Since Python 3 is not
backward compatible and not all the modules are upgraded into Python 3,
we will use the latest version of Python 2 (2.7 as of writing this) in
this workshop, which should also be the default for Mac OS X and Linux.

A nice instruction for installing Python on Windows is at The
Hitchhiker's Guide to Python
site\footnote{\url{http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/win/}}.

Installation of pip is optional but encouraged since pip is the tool for
installing and managing Python packages. PIP installation guide is
at \url{http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/installing.html}.
